# About Mastermind Game

Mastermind Game is a web application built and implemented by Node, Express, React.js and Ant Design technologies. On the website, users (players) can see game rules, create a new game, play the game and see the results. Moreover, users can choose the game level when starting a game and get hints when they need to! These extended features make this game more fun!

  ## Basic Features
- System generates 4-digits combination by calling API on random.org (https://www.random.org/integers)
- Players can create a new game and have 10 times to enter a 4 digits combination to guess. 
- System provides feedback based on the user's guesses.
- System provides detailed information during the game. E.g. user’s guess history, remaining guess times, etc.
- System shows the game result (won/lost) and correct combination when the game is ended. The correct combination won’t be available on the client side until the game is over.
